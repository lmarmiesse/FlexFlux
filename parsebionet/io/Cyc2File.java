 * Project : parseBioNet
 * Package : baobab.parseBioNet.applications
 * File : Cyc2File.java
 * 
 * Purpose :
 * Creates a sbml or a tabulated file from a local biocyc database
 * The user can choose 
 * - the code of the organism in the pathway tools.
 * - the type of reactionNodes in the network ha wants to deal with :
 * 		"metab-all"		= metab-smm rxns plus all other enzyme-catalyzed reactionNodes.
 *      "metab-smm"    	= metab-pathways reactionNodes plus all other reactionNodes not in pathways whose
 *         					substrates are all small molecules.
 *      "metab-pathways" = All reactionNodes found within metabolic pathways. May include a handfull 
 *       				 	of reactionNodes whose substrates are macromolecules, e.g., ACP.  Excludes transport reactionNodes.
 *      "enzyme"         = All enzyme-catalyzed reactionNodes of Species (instances of classes
 *        					EC-Reactions or Unclassified-Reactions)
 *       "small-molecule" = All reactionNodes whose substrates are all small molecules, as opposed to 
 *       					macromolecules. Excludes transport.
 *       "transport"      = All transport reactionNodes of Species
 *       "dna"            = All DNA Binding Reactions
 *       "sigtrans"       = Signal-transduction reactionNodes
 *       "protein-small-molecule-reaction"	= One substrate is a protein and one is a small 
 *       										molecule
 *       "protein-binds-dna"	= One substrate is a protein and one is a DNA-binding-site
 *       "protein-reaction"		= All substrates are proteins
 *       "trna-reaction"		= One substrate is a tRNA
 *       "spontaneous"			= Spontaneous reactionNodes
 *       "non-spontaneous"		= Non-spontaneous reactionNodes
 * - to keep only the reactionNodes which occurs in the metabolic pathways
 * and only the primary compounds (onlyPrimaries = 1) or not (onlyPrimaries = 0)
 * - to avoid all the generic compounds (ex : an aldehyde) (keepClassCompounds=0) or not 
 * 		(keepClassCompounds=1)
 * - the type of file : "sbml" or "tab" to save the network in a sbml file or in a tabulated file
 * - the filename where the network must be saved
 * 
 * Needs a local installation of the pathway tools and the libunixdomainsocket.so dynamic library
 * (available in the lib directory and which can be compiled with the MakeFile in the baoabcyc 
 * directory
 * 
 * Usage :
 *
